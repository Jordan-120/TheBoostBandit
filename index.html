            <h2>Cobalt SS/TC Description</h2>
            <p>Only 3,168 Cobalt SS Turbo coupes were ever manufactured. This makes Cobalt SS/TC one of the rarest vehicles every produced.
                This was GM's first foray into the tuner market. The Cobalt SS switched from supercharged LSJ to turbocharged LNF in 2007.
                Also adding 24 mm front stabilizer bar, 22 mm rear stabilizer bar, F35 tuned suspension and a limited slip differential. 
                Due to this switch, the Chevrolet Cobalt SS/TC holds the record for the fastest lap time for a front-wheel 
                drive production car at the NÃ¼rburgring Nordschleife, with a time of 8:22.85 minutes. This vehicle boasted extreme performance over appearance.
                The downside to this was the lack of appeal to the general consumers. Production then ended in 2010. 
                These cars are favorited by racers today due to the low cost for track ready performance.

            <h3>Electric Audio Works</h3>
            <p>They are the new and upcoming designers in car audio. They are a Canadian Company based out of Alberta. They are one of the few companies that have catered their designs to
                endure extreme temperatures we experience in Canada. Most sound systems are not designed to handle such harsh conditions, which often lead to blown or cracked speaekrs. 
                Their patented speakers not only endure extreme temperatures but thrive. If you wish to hear their quality personally, ask me for a demonstration to hear them firsthand to see why they 
                are breaking through in the competitive car audio market.
